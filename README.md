Install the project:
```yarn install```

Start the project:
```yarn start```

Test UI with Storybook:
```yarn run storybook```

Note:

The main difficulty was to achieve all the functionalities in the given time. As discussed in my first interview, I had never used react-table. I decided to implement it for this test, but the learning curve made me lose some time. So I sacrificed the "view project" feature, which is just a simple window.alert that appears when you click on a project title.
